Notes: 
forEach is a built-in method for the array object. What it does is, it calls a function one time for each element in the array.
employees.forEach will call the function add for each element of the array.There are three parameters that the forEach method will pass in: item, counter, array.
forEach method looks to the array and for each time it calls the function, it will pass in the item, the index, and also creates a reference to the entire array. 
The same behavior can be duplicated with a for loop, but this is used for simplicity, since it is a built-in-method.
