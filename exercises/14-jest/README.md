## Unit Testing in JavaScript with Jest

### Notes on testing with Jest ###

Unit Testing in JavaScript with Jest requires Node.js to be globally installed in the system.

To start, run **npm init -y** in the project directory to initialize all the default values. This will create a package.json file to manage dependencies for working with Node in the porject directory.

To install jest, run **npm i --save-dev jest**. Then change a line in the package.json file to **"test":"jest"**.

To verify that jest has been installed properly (and to run the the actuall tests), run **npm test**.
