## Using Export and Import

**Notes:**To access the import functionality, we need to access it through a web server (otherwise, there will be problems with CORS). 

To run a web server, we need to go to the directory with all the files (README.md, index.html, main.js, module.js). Then, using the terminal, type **npx http-server** which will run a web server and will serve up index.html file on port 8080. Please note that for this **npx** to work you need NodeJS installed first.

To view the file, type **localhost:8080** in the browser window.
